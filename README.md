# Supabase Teaching Club Material

This repo contains source code for a teaching club showing of features of [Supabase](https://supabase.com). The folder `./backend` has all the migrations and code for a local supabase instance. The folder ./frontend contains a react app that uses the supabase client to interact with the database. The whole application is a crude clone of giessdenkiez.de.
